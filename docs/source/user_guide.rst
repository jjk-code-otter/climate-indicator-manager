   Screenshot indicating the important elements of the dashboard

The dashboard is split up into individual cards. Each card has the
following elements which are numbered in the image above:

1. A main image with an appropriate title
2. Links to the main image in different formats: png, svg and pdf. The
   last two of these are vector formats, so suitable for publication and editing.
3. A link to a zip file containing the datasets shown in the image. Clicking on the link
   will download the zip file. There is also a link to a webppage describing
   the data format. Each file in the zip archive is a csv file,
   and can be opened in Excel.
4. A link to "references and processing". The link takes you further down
   the page to a description of the indicator and other important information,
   including a link to the original data source, the correct citation, and details
   of the processing applied to each data set.
5. On the main dashboard there is button marked "Click for more indicators". Clicking
   the button takes you to a set of related indicators.

Image formats
=============

The main images are available in three formats:

1. png - Portable Network Graphics format. The images are relatively high resolution
   (1370 x 900 pixels) so should work well in most situations. The downside is that
   the file sizes are relatively large.
2. svg - Scalable Vector Graphics format. This is a vector format, so the images can be
   scaled and zoomed without loss of quality. As such, they are ideal for use in publications.
3. pdf - Portabl Document Format. This is a vector format, so the images can be scaled
   and zoomed without loss of quality. As such, they are ideal for use in publications.

Data format
===========

The data for each indicator are stored in zip files. These can be opened in windows by
right clicking and selecting "Extract all". When extracted, you get a directory containing
one or more csv files (Comma Separated Value). Csv files can be read by most data handling
programs, including Excel.
