Precipitation includes rain, snow, sleet, and hail that falls to the ground. Too much or too little precipitation can have significant socioeconomic and environmental impacts and can lead to flooding and drought. Precipitation is measured at weather stations and rain gauges around the world. There is no single key global indicator associated with precipitation, but as local variations in precipitation are linked to local impacts, maps of precipitation quantiles (which categorise precipitation according to whether it is in the top 20% and 10% or lowest 20% and 10%) and anomalies (differences from the long-term average) are shown here. Global and regional patterns of rainfall are affected by short-term climate drivers such as the El Nino Southern Oscillation and the North Atlantic Oscillation.

What the IPCC says

<p>
<a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdf" target="_blank"  rel="noopener">A.1.4</a> Globally averaged precipitation over land has likely increased since 1950, with a faster rate of increase since the 1980s (medium confidence). It is likely that human influence contributed to the pattern of observed precipitation changes since the mid-20th century and extremely likely that human influence contributed to the pattern of observed changes in near-surface ocean salinity.

<a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdf" target="_blank"  rel="noopener">A.3.2</a> The frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation events has increased since the 1950s over most land area for which observational data are sufficient for trend analysis (high confidence), and human-induced climate change is likely the main driver. Human-induced climate change has contributed to increases in agricultural and ecological droughts in some regions due to increased land evapotranspiration (medium confidence).
