Sea-ice concentrations are estimated from microwave radiances measured from satellites (from 1979). Sea-ice extent is calculated as the area of ocean grid cells where the sea-ice concentration exceeds 15%. Although there are relatively large differences in the absolute extent between data sets, they agree well on the year-to-year changes and the trends.
