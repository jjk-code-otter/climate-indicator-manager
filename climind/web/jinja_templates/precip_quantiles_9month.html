<p>
Precipitation quantiles are based on the nine months aggregated GPCC Monitoring Product and First Guess Monthly product. The baseline period is 1991-2020, using Full Data Monthly in its latest version. Quality controlled rain gauge (in situ) data are used and the quality control protocol depends on the data set. The percentiles are not calculated for those grid cells, where the precipitation total aggregated in the reference period is below ten millimetres.
