Earths energy imbalance is a measure of the net energy flux into the earth system. When the EEI is positive, the amount of energy entering the earth system is larger than the energy leaving the earth system and energy accumulates in the ocean, atmosphere, land and cryosphere, leading to warming. When the EEI is negative, the opposite happens.
