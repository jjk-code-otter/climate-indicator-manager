    Human influence is very likely the main driver of the global retreat of glaciers since the 1990s and the decrease in
    Arctic sea ice area between 1979-1988 and 2010-2019 (decreases of about 40% in September and about 10% in March).
    There has been no significant trend in Antarctic sea ice area from 1979 to 2020 due to regionally opposing trends
    and large internal variability. Human influence very likely contributed to the decrease in Northern Hemisphere
    spring snow cover since 1950. It is very likely that human influence has contributed to the observed surface melting
    of the Greenland Ice Sheet over the past two decades, but there is only limited evidence, with medium agreement, of
    human influence on the Antarctic Ice Sheet mass loss.
