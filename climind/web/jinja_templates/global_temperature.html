    A key indicator of climate chanage is the global mean temperature. This measured
    the change in temperature over time averaged across the Earth's surface. Increased
    concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are the primary driver of the
    long-term increase in global mean temperature.

    The land has warmed more rapidly than the ocean and the rate of warming has been
    highest in the Arctic, which has warmed around two to four times faster than the global
    mean.

    Each of the last four decades has been successively warmer than any decade that preceded it since 1850. Global
    surface temperature in the first two decades of the 21st century (2001–2020) was 0.99 [0.84 to 1.10] °C higher than
    1850–1900. Global surface temperature was 1.09 [0.95 to 1.20] °C higher in 2011–2020 than 1850–1900, with larger
    increases over land (1.59 [1.34 to 1.83] °C) than over the ocean (0.88 [0.68 to 1.01] °C). The estimated increase in
    global surface temperature since AR5 is principally due to further warming since 2003–2012 (+0.19 [0.16 to 0.22]
    °C). Additionally, methodological advances and new datasets contributed approximately 0.1°C to the updated estimate
    of warming in AR6.

    The likely range of total human-caused global surface temperature increase from 1850–1900 to 2010–201911 is
    0.8°C to 1.3°C, with a best estimate of 1.07°C. It is likely that well-mixed GHGs contributed a warming of 1.0°C
    to 2.0°C, other human drivers (principally aerosols) contributed a cooling of 0.0°C to 0.8°C, natural drivers
    changed global surface temperature by –0.1°C to +0.1°C, and internal variability changed it by –0.2°C to +0.2°C. It
    is very likely that well-mixed GHGs were the main driver of tropospheric warming since 1979 and extremely likely
    that human-caused stratospheric ozone depletion was the main driver of cooling of the lower stratosphere between
    1979 and the mid-1990s.
