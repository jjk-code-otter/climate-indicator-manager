This page is a companion to the <a href="https://library.wmo.int/index.php?lvl=notice_display&id=97" target="_blank">WMO State of the Global climate</a> reports. It provides access to the latest versions of selected key global indicators used in the report.
</p>
<p>
Global climate indicators provide a broad view of climate change at the largest scale, encompassing the composition of the atmosphere, energy changes, and the responses of the land, ocean, and ice. These indicators are closely related to one another. For example, the rise in CO<sub>2</sub> and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere leads to an imbalance of energy and thus warming of the atmosphere and ocean. Warming of the ocean in turn leads to rising sea levels, to which is added the melting of ice on land in response to increasing atmospheric temperatures.
</p>
<p>
The global indicators draw on a wide range of data sets, which are listed at the bottom of the page. Figures are updated at least annually, with some data sets being updated more frequently.
</p>
<p>
Under each of the figures, you will find links to the images in multiple file formats (png, pdf and svg), as well as a set of data as shown in the figure in <a href="https://help.ceda.ac.uk/article/105-badc-csv" target="_blank">a common comma-separated values (csv) format</a>.
