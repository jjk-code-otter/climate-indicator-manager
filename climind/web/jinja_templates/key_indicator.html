This page is a companion to the <a href="https://library.wmo.int/index.php?lvl=notice_display&id=97" target="_blank">WMO State of the Global climate</a> reports. It provides access to the latest versions of selected key global indicators.
</p>
<p>
Global climate indicators provide a broad view of climate change at a global scale, encompassing the composition of the atmosphere, energy changes, and the response of the land, ocean, and ice. These indicators are closely interrelated. For example, the rise in CO2 and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere leads to an imbalance of energy and thus warming of the atmosphere and ocean. Warming of the ocean in turn leads to rising sea levels, to which is added the melting of ice on land in response to increasing atmospheric temperatures.

<p>
The global indicators draw on a wide range of data sets, which are listed at the bottom of the page. Figures are updated at least annually, with some data sets being updated more frequently.

<p>
Under each of the figures, you will find links to the images in multiple file format, as well as a set of data in a common comma-separated values (csv) format.
