    reports. It provides access to the latest versions of selected key global indicators.
</p>
<p>
    Global climate indicators provide a broad view of climate change at a global scale,
    encompassing the composition of the atmosphere, energy changes, and the response of
    the land, ocean and ice. These indicators are closely interrelated.
    For example, the rise in CO<sub>2</sub> and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere
    leads to an imbalance of energy and thus warming of the atmosphere and ocean.
    Warming of the ocean in turn leads to rising sea levels, to which is added the melting of ice
    on land in response to increasing atmospheric temperatures.
</p>
<p>
    The global indicators draw on a wide range of data sets, which are listed at the bottom
    of the page. Figures are updated at least annually, with some data sets being updated more
    frequently.
</p>
<p>
    Under each of the figures, you will find links to the images in multiple
    file format, as well as a set of data in a common comma-separated values (csv) format.

    What the IPCC says
</h2>
<p>
    <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/resources/spm-headline-statements#:~:text=of%20the%20Climate-,A.1,-It%20is%20unequivocal"
       target="_blank">A.1</a>
    It is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land. Widespread and rapid changes
    in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere and biosphere have occurred.
</p>
<p>
    <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/resources/spm-headline-statements#:~:text=biosphere%20have%C2%A0occurred.-,A.2,-The%20scale%20of"
       target="_blank">A.2</a>
    The scale of recent changes across the climate system as a whole - and the present state of many aspects of the
    climate system - are unprecedented over many centuries to many thousands of years.
</p>
<p>
    <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/resources/spm-headline-statements#:~:text=thousands%20of%20years.-,A.3,-Human%2Dinduced%20climate"
       target="_blank">A.3</a>
    Human-induced climate change is already affecting many weather and climate extremes in every region across the
    globe. Evidence of observed changes in extremes such as heatwaves, heavy precipitation, droughts, and tropical
    cyclones, and, in particular, their attribution to human influence, has strengthened since AR5.
