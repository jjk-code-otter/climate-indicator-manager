    Most of the excess energy that accumulates in the Earth system due to increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases
    is taken up by the ocean. The added energy warms the ocean, and the consequent thermal expansion of the water leads
    to sea-level rise, to which is added melting land ice. The surface layers of the ocean have warmed more rapidly than
    the interior, mirrored in the rise of global mean sea-surface temperature and in the increased incidence of marine
    heatwaves. As the concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere increases, so too does the concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> in the
    ocean. This affects ocean chemistry, lowering the average pH of the water, a process known as ocean acidification.
    All these changes have a broad range of impacts and interactions in the ocean and coastal areas.

    It is virtually
    certain that the global upper ocean (0-700 m) has warmed since the 1970s and extremely likely that
    human influence is the main driver. It is virtually certain that human-caused CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are the main driver of
    current global acidification of the surface open ocean. There is high confidence that oxygen levels have dropped in
    many upper ocean regions since the mid-20th century and medium confidence that human influence contributed to this
    drop.

    Global mean sea level increased by 0.20 [0.15 to 0.25] m between 1901 and 2018. The average rate of sea level rise
    was 1.3 [0.6 to 2.1] mm/yr between 1901 and 1971, increasing to 1.9 [0.8 to 2.9] mm/yr between 1971 and 2006,
    and further increasing to 3.7 [3.2 to 4.2] mm/yr between 2006 and 2018 (high confidence). Human influence was very
    likely the main driver of these increases since at least 1971.

        2</a> Ocean pH has declined globally at the surface over the past four decades (virtually certain) and in all
    ocean basins in the ocean interior (high confidence) over the past 2-3 decades. A long-term increase in surface open
    ocean pH occurred over the past 50 million years (high confidence), and surface ocean pH as low as recent times is
    uncommon in the last 2 million years (medium confidence)
